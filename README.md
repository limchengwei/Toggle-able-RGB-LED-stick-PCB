# Toggle-able-RGB-LED-stick-PCB

I would like to thank JLCPCB for sponsoring this project.

This toggle-able RGB stick can produce 7 different colours - Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta, and White by setting the switch to different combination.

We choose the resistors based on the current, I = (V supply - V forward) / R.

The current is 0.02A and the supply voltage is 5V.

R = (5 - 2) / 0.02 = 150 ohm for the Red LED.

R = (5 - 3) / 0.02 = 100 ohm for the Green and Blue LED each.

We can solder a USB C female board to the VCC and GND copper pad for the supply voltage.

Things we need:

5050 RGB LED 6 pins * 16

DIP 3 pins SMD * 1

1210 Resistor 100 ohm * 2

1210 Resistor 150 ohm * 1
	
USB C Female board * 1

Hot Air Station, Industrial * 1

Solder Paste, Rework
