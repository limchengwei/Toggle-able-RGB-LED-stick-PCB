# Toggle-able-RGB-LED-stick-PCB

I would like to thank [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/RAT) for sponsoring this project.

This toggle-able RGB stick can produce 7 different colours - Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta, and White by setting the switch to different combination.

We choose the resistors based on the current, I = (V supply - V forward) / R.

The supply voltage is 5V.

R = 150 ohm for the Red LED.

R = 100 ohm for the Green and Blue LED each.

We can solder a USB C female board to the VCC and GND copper pad for the supply voltage.

Things we need:
